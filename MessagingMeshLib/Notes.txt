TODO
----
- Do the C# language version thing, eg for =new()

- Change cpp Message addField() methods to addFieldString() etc

- Connection must not make more than one subscription to the gateway for a
  subject. It should check if the subsciption has already been made and map
  the existing subscription ID to multiple callbacks if necessary.

- Support a Tag ('closure') for subscriptions, returned with callbacks

- ConnectionImpl::m_subscriptions needs to be thread safe

- Think about use of std::string. We want to encode strings as UTF-8

- Add getField() helper methods to Message

- Replace enum with enum class

- Handle fast producers and slow consumers

- I'm not convinced that the ConnectionImpl and Subscription dtors are properly thread safe

- Think about making Socket::write subscriptionIDOverride thing more generic?
  - ie, so that the (generic-ish) socket doesn't know such a specific detail
