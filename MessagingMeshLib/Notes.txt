TODO
----
- Test a message between C++ and C# with all field types
  - C++ => C#
  - C# => C++

- C++ -pub with C# -sub works weirdly
  - Buffers lots of memory in the publisher
  - Doesn't work properly if the publisher or subscriber are restarted (with the same gateway)

- Do we need the wakeUp() thing? (A: Yes, when running in PMQ mode)

- Support field types (and add tests): 
  - BLOB (C++, C#): Change read_bytes, write_bytes to encode the size as well?
  - BOOL (C++)
  - UNSIGNED_INT32 (C++)
  - SIGNED_INT64 (C++)
  - UNSIGNED_INT64 (C++)
  - Make sure enums are lined up

- Better disconnection handling
  - Not all cases of gateway and/or clients dying are handled well

- ConnectionParams class (C++, C#)
  - Include whether to call back on the connection's thread or to need manual dispatch (PMQ)

- Clean up removed subscriptions from the interest-graph

- ConnectionImpl::m_subscriptions needs to be thread safe
  - I'm not convinced that the ConnectionImpl and Subscription dtors are properly thread safe

- Replace enum with enum class

- Handle fast producers and slow consumers
