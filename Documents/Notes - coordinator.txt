Central service for mesh management and monitoring (MessagingMeshCoordinator)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Gateways can register with this
  - To note that they are managing a service
  - To discover other Gateways managing the service
  - ie, to discover the mesh rather than using config

- Gateways can report statistics

- What should this central service be called?
  - MeshManager
  - MeshMonitor
  - MeshCoordinator
  - As above but MessagingMeshCoordinator (etc)

- I quite like MessagingMeshCoordinator


How does the Gateway talk to the Coordinator?
---------------------------------------------
- The gateway talks to the coodinator to:
  - Manage / discover the mesh
  - Send statistics

- The gateway may be runnning multiple services
  - Each of these needs to manage its mesh
  - Each of these needs to send statistics

- Options
  a. One connection to the coordinator per service
  b. One connection to the coordinator shared by all the services

- Option b seems better
  - But we need to be careful to marshal events to the service's UV thread
  - (Which should be fairly easy to do.)

- IDEA: Let's say that the MeshManager connects to the Coordinator using the client-style Connection
  - Set to call back on the connection's own thread (ie, PMQ not needed)


  Gateway config to use the Coordinator
  -------------------------------------
  - You can optionally set meshes to be managed by the Coordinator

  - The Coordinator should be optional
    - For mesh management and for statistics
    - ie, You do no need to run it
