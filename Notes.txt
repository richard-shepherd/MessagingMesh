TODO
----
- Talk to Maxim (again) about string encoding - for both C++ and C#. Can this be the client's responsibility?

- C++ -pub with C# -sub works weirdly
  - Buffers lots of memory in the publisher
  - Doesn't work properly if the publisher or subscriber are restarted (with the same gateway)

- Is Connection thread safe?
  - Is the socket sending thread safe? eg, will sends from different threads get 'mixed up'? (Though they are queued to one thread?)
  - Can you subscribe from multiple threads? (C#, C++)
  - Can you send messages from multiple threads? (C#, C++)
  - Can you sendRequest from multiple threads? (C#, C++)

- Do the client side subscription cache thing for C#

- Message::getAllFields (C++, C#)

- Think about pimpl vs C++20 modules

- Better disconnection handling
  - Not all cases of gateway and/or clients dying are handled well

- Clean up removed subscriptions from the interest-graph

- ConnectionImpl::m_subscriptions needs to be thread safe
  - I'm not convinced that the ConnectionImpl and Subscription dtors are properly thread safe

- Handle fast producers and slow consumers
  - What happens if a consumer is slow? Does it slow down publication from the Gateway to other clients?

- Add Message::getSize() and use that (or something close) as intial buffer estimate.  (C++)

- Return the buffer size from Connection.sendMessage()  (C++)

- Performance (C#)
  - Sensitive to the initial Buffer size. The initial allocation is slow. 
    - Use a shared pool of byte[]???
